### Licensing and Copyright

This project follows the [REUSE Specification](https://reuse.software/spec/) for license and copyright information. The following guidelines should be followed:

1. All source files must include SPDX license and copyright information directly in file headers:

   SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Chen Linxuan <me@black-desk.cn>
   SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
   """
   ```

2. Only use `.reuse/dep5` for files that cannot include inline license headers (e.g., binary files, data files)

3. To verify license compliance before submitting your contribution:
   ```bash
   # Clean untracked files first
   git clean -fdx

   # Run reuse lint
   poetry run reuse lint
   ```

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/black-desk/gmail-tui.git
   cd gmail-tui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

4. Format code:
   ```bash
   poetry run ruff format .
   ```

5. Check code style:
   ```bash
   poetry run ruff check .
   ```

6. Check for trailing whitespace:
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/check_trailing_whitespace.py
   ```

7. Verify license compliance:
   ```bash
   git clean -fdx
   poetry run reuse lint
   ```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The following checks are run on every pull request and push to the main branch:

1. **CI Workflow**: Runs on multiple Python versions and performs:
   - Trailing whitespace checks
   - Formatting checks
   - Code style checks
   - Unit tests

2. **REUSE Compliance**: Ensures all files have proper copyright and license information.

3. **Dependabot**: Automatically checks for dependency updates and security vulnerabilities.
   - Creates pull requests for outdated dependencies
   - Flags dependencies with known security issues
   - Updates GitHub Actions workflows

These checks help maintain code quality and consistency. Pull requests will not be merged until all checks pass.

For local development, make sure to run the same checks before submitting a pull request:

```bash
# Run all checks
poetry run python scripts/check_trailing_whitespace.py
poetry run ruff format --check .
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run pytest
poetry run reuse lint
```
